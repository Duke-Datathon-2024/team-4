Some twitching was noted on [**6-22**] in the\\nafternoon.  Of note two lumbar punctures were attempted at\\nbedside without successful return of cerebrospinal fluid. On\\n[**6-23**] at noon, had epileptiform activity in left frontal and\\ntemporal lobes.  Had LP in IR on [**6-24**] which showed no elevated\\nWBCs or RBCs.  Did have elevated protein to 363 of unclear\\nsignificance as pt not ill or febrile.  On [**6-24**] at 3pm, pt spit\\nup mucous and was quite difficult to arouse.  Suspected seizure\\nactivity.  Placed pt back in bed.  ~20 min later, completely\\nunresponsive, eyes rolling up.  A few minutes later, was\\nlethargic but responsive, tracking.  Given this event was c/w\\nepileptiform activity. She was increased on Keppra to 1500 mg\\n[**Hospital1 **] and Vimpat to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Dilantin was continued and she was\\ntransitioned oral dosing of 330 mg of extended release tabs. Her\\ndilantin level was 11 on [**6-28**].\\n\\nCardiovascular:\\nMs. [**Known lastname 12330**] was not hypertensive on admission; however, she\\nhas had periods of hypertension throughout her admission running\\nbetween 150-180 systolic blood pressures.  During seizures the\\npatient was noted to have systolic blood pressures which\\nexceeded 200mmHg for which Hydralizine was acutely used to\\nresolve events.  Lisinopril was increased to 40mg qDay which\\nimproved her pressures to 130-150mmHg. She was also started on\\nImdur and since these interventions has been stable.\\n\\nRenal:\\nTransplant nephrology was consulted for the course of Ms.\\n[**Known lastname 12330**] hospital stay.

Per nephrology, the patient was continued on cellcept\\nand rapamune for her DCD renal transplant, with an increase of\\nRapamune to 5mg per day.\\n\\nInfectious:\\nOn presentation, concern for infection was high given the\\npatient's immunosuppressed status, temperature of 100.3F, and\\nbreakthrough seizures.  Two lumbar punctures were attempted\\nwithout success.  Empiric antibiotics/antivirals were started.\\nA lumbar puncture revealed a cell count within reference ranges\\nwith the exception of elevated protein.

She did not\\nhave any URI symptoms, and CXR did not suggest pneumonia. She is\\na schoolteacher and was exposed to several children with Strep\\nthroat the days prior to her symptom onset.  She also did not\\ncomplain of any urinary symptoms and UA did not suggest UTI.\\nBecause of the hypotension requiring large amount of fluid and\\npressor, she received a femoral line.  She was started on Unasyn\\nfor her retropharyngeal infection on [**2103-10-10**].  Her blood\\npressure and urine output responded to fluid and pressor, which\\nwas gradually weaned off.  Femoral line was discontinued in the\\nevening of [**10-11**].  BP continued to be stable.  She was\\ntransferred to the floor from the ICU on [**2103-10-13**]. On the\\nfloor she continued to improve, and remained hemodynamically\\nstable.\\n.\\n# Retropharyngeal infection.  CT neck did not show abscess, and\\nENT was consulted.  Her airway remained patent without need of\\nintubation throughout the hospital course.  Patient began\\nantibiotics with Unasyn 3 g every 6 hours on [**2103-10-10**].  ENT\\nwas consulted and thought that if her symptoms worsened despite\\nantibiotics, dexamethasone 10 mg should be started.  Steroids\\nwere not needed. Pain control was managed with acetaminophen and\\nibuprofen.  She was kept on a clear sip diet given difficulty\\nwith swallowing [**12-26**] swelling in her neck and later advanced to\\nsoft diet with supplements such as Ensure.  Patient be treated\\nfor a total of 14 days of antibiotics.  Blood cultures remained\\nnegative.\\n\\n# Acute Renal Failure, likely pre-renal given presenting sepsis.\\n Patient's creatinine rose to 1.2 on the day of admission with\\nlow urine output.  However, with aggressive IVF, urine output\\nimproved and creatinine returned to baseline.\\n\\n# Afib with RVR.  She did not take home medication on the day of\\nadmission.  Her HR was consistently in the 110s-120s off of\\nmedication, and of note, she recently stopped taking amiodarone\\nbecause of abnormal thyroid function tests.  Her initial INR in\\nthe ED was supratherapeutic, so a dose was held and later\\nresumed given that no invasive procedure was planned for her\\nretropharyngeal infection.  She resumed short acting metoprolol\\n100 mg TID (close to home dose) as pressor was weaned off,\\nhowever, HR was persistently elevated, so diltiazem was\\ninitiated.  Of note, she missed several doses of metoprolol\\nbecause of SBP in the 90s while on diltiazem, so metoprolol was\\ndiscontinued on [**10-13**].  Her HR remained in the 80s-90s and SBP\\nmostly in the 100-120s on diltiazem 60 mg TID alone. Patient was\\ndischarged on Diltiazem XR, as her HR remained well controlled.\\nPatient's cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**].\\nShe was continued on Coumadin, and at the time of discharge, her\\nINR was supratherapeutic. She had remained on her home regimen,\\nhowever this was decreased to 1 mg po q 1600, holding dose 11/23\\nand [**10-17**], pending [**Hospital 197**] clinic follow up.\\n\\n# Shortness of Breath/acute diastolic heart failure: likely due\\nto pulmonary edema from the aggressive IVF resuscitation in the\\nsetting of AF with RVR. She was not symptomatic on the floor,\\nwas oxyygenating well without dyspnea, so diuretics were not\\ncontinued. An echocardiogram was ordered, which showed normal\\nsystolic function, but the study was not able to adequately\\nassess diastolic function.  On the floor, she did not show any\\nevidence of heart failure.\\n\\n# Altered Mental Status.  Given her initial confusional state\\nwas similar to prior CVA presentation, she received a CT head\\nwithout contrast which did not show acute intracranial bleeding\\nor swelling to suggest new stroke.  It is likely this is\\ndelirium [**12-26**] underlying infection given the improve of her\\nsymptoms and no other neurological deficits to suggest even TIA.\\n Her delirium resolved with the therapy mentioned above.\\n\\nFEN:  soft diet with Ensure\\nPPx:  INR supratherapeutic\\nCode:  FULL\\nDISPO: to home\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nAspirin 81 mg daily\\nDiovan 160 mg daily\\nMagnesium oxide 400 mg daily\\nMetoprolol succinate 350 mg daily\\nPulmicort flexhale 2 puff inhaler\\nWarfarin 2 mg MWFSun 1 mg TThSat\\nSimvastatin 20 mg daily\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable\\nPO DAILY (Daily).\\n2.
